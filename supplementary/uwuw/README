0) Ensure your versions of OpenMC, Pyne and DagMC are compatible.

Date: 10/12/20

DagMC v pre 3.2.0, branch develop, e.g. commit 44b7d4db87c717d7b77f28828f13b4da4bc3b0f9
Pyne v 0.6 branch develop commit b7c4932c0399e6a0881aea943b392fb97cd0b6bd
OpenMC repo helen-brooks/openmc branch external-mesh commit d52e9e07a7c3ce640929147b6d0c4ba15296702a

Alternatively while not currently compatible with OpenMC the following DagMC+Pyne combination are compatible
DagMC branch 3.2.0-rc2
Pyne 0.7 branch 0.7.0-rc
When OpenMC has been updated to use Pyne 0.7 this will be the recommended combination.
****************************************************************

1) Create a local pyne h5m library:
$  python3 make_pyne_library.py

2) Preprocess your dagmc file. Two options:

i) To simply add metadata to your geometry.h5m file
$  uwuw_preproc -v geometry.h5m -l material_library.h5

ii) To create a new file 
$  # First need to copy - necessary because uwuw_preproc only appends the metadata
$  cp geometry.h5m dagmc.h5m 
$  uwuw_preproc -v geometry.h5m -l material_library.h5 -o dagmc.h5m

Now copy your *.h5m file to /openmc-working-dir/dagmc.h5m
(OpenMC expects the file to be called dagmc.h5m)
